This repository was created using the code from these repositories:
* https://github.com/nociza/Bimg
* https://github.com/acheong08/BingImageCreator

I am very thankful to the creators of these repos, they did an amazing job. I simplified the algorithm a lot and added a better (in my opinion) way to invoke the tool programmatically.
